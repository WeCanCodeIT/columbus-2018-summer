## How to Talk About Your Projects During an Interview
Talking about your technical projects you have listed on your resume is an important aspect of the interview process. An interviewer could ask you to speak about these projects as early as an initial phone screening to a technical screening a few interviews into the process. This is your opportunity to show off your skills through applications you've built, but an interviewer won't get the information he/she/they need out of it if you have not prepared. Here are some talking points to help you prepare for the instances in which you are asked to speak about your projects.

### Talking Points to Consider
- [ ] Introduce the Project
  - [ ] General overview: What were you tasked with?
  - [ ] Was the project individual or team? If team, emphasize collaboration.
- [ ] Tools, technologies, platforms, languages used
  - Note: The depth at which you speak of these should depend on your audience
- [ ] What was your role in developing the project?
  - [ ] Talk about personal achievements vs. team
- [ ] Challenge of the project and how you solved it (Focus on you).
- [ ] Why are you proud/How do you know the project was successful?
- [ ] How did the project prepare you for your career/for what's next?
  - [ ] What would you do differently?

Things to Avoid:
- Rabbit holes and rambling (Allow for the follow-up question)
- Sharing a negative perspective when explaning challenges (Focus on positive spin)
- If you don't know the answer to the question, don't lie

### Homework
- [ ] Write out answers for each of the projects you have listed on your resume.
- [ ] Practice, practice, practice!
