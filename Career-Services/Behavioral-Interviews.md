## Behavioral Interviews
Behavioral interviews are centered around questions, such as "Tell me about a time when..." or "Can you give me an example of..." as a means for the interviewer to get a sense of the way you've handled situations in the past to better gauge how you may handle them while working at their company. Some questions may not follow the same format to hint to you that they are behavioral, but a good way to look at it is if the interviewer is asking about something you "did", use the behavioral approach. This is a great opportunity, again, to talk about your past accomplishments.

### How to Answer Behavioral Questions
**Step 1:** Describe the situation.

**Step 2:** Describe the action you took.

**Step 3:** Describe the result of your action.

### Tips for Answering
