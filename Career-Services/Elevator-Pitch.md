## Elevator Pitch
An elevator pitch is your opportunity to sell yourself effectively in a limited amount of time.  If you found yourself in an elevator with the CEO of your dream company, or the manager of the department you most want to work for, someone who you may not have access to day-to-day, what would you say so that they would remember you?  Your goal is to get the most important information about yourself delivered to them in a short period of time (the ride to the floor they are traveling to) in a way that they will not only see you in the best possible light, but also remember you after they’re no longer in your presence.

## Discussion Questions
- How have you made positive first impressions in the past, or had others make positive first impressions on you?
- How could the opportunity to briefly meet someone who could be influential in your career be a negative experience?  How can you avoid this?

## Example
Old Elevator Pitch:
“I’m a stay-at-home mom, and I’ve recently started doing web design.”

New Elevator Pitch:
“I’m a web designer who’s making the Internet a more beautiful and positive place! My background in counselling helps me understand what the bloggers and small business owners I work with need. And, thanks to working in administration AND now being a stay-at-home mom, I’m great at coming up with solutions, no matter what you throw at me.”
