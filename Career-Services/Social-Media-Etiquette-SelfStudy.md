## Social Media Etiquette (Self Study)
Most of us have become accustomed to sharing various parts of our lives on social media.  Depending on the platform, this may include sharing personal and professional information, negative and positive parts of our lives, and various types of media.  However, while we may consider the opinions of our intended audience for this content, many of us forget to consider how accessible this information is to others, or the overall impression it gives many people of us.  

Include discussion questions to get the conversation started:
- Do you post differently on different social media platforms?  If yes, how on each platform?  If not, is this something you should be considering?
- What impression of you does the content on each social media platform provide?  Are you happy with this impression for your intended audience?  Would you be happy for your professional contacts (co-workers, managers, subordinates, current or future) to have this impression of you?
- Do you have security settings on your social media?  How often do you review these settings?  Are you confident that these settings are protecting you from having content viewed by anyone you wouldn’t want to view it?

## How-to Steps
- Consider which social media platforms you use.  (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.)   On each of these platforms, you are presenting a certain image of yourself.  This might look different on each platform.
- Review, or ask a trusted friend to review, your content on each of these platforms.  While there will be obvious, acceptable differences (your personal interests are appropriate to post about on Facebook, despite being unlikely to be the right content for LinkedIn) you should always consider whether that image is still positive, and if not, how you might consider changing it.  Some potential things to consider:
..- Are my comments derogatory, offensive, or otherwise present me in a poor light?
..- Do my pictures represent someone I am proud to be recognized as?
..- Do I include content that would be uncomfortable for me if presented in professional setting?
- Review the content you have across each platform.  Is it an appropriate choice for the platform it’s on?  Some examples to consider:
..- Is the content I have shared, created, or commented on in LinkedIn related to my professional goals and image?
..- Is my Twitter shared only in the realm it is appropriate (do you tweet in a way that is relevant to your professional brand?  If not, are you including it in professional forums such as LinkedIn?)
..- Is my content on unprotected platforms part of the image I want to project?
- Review your security settings often!  If your Facebook content is only intended for close friends and family, make certain your posts are marked this way.  Look into blocking sharing of your content, and blocking those who fall outside of your approved list from viewing.  Security settings for several social media platforms are below.
- Don’t assume that your security is fail proof!  Get in the habit of asking yourself whether you would be comfortable with certain people associating this content with you before posting.  Would you be uncomfortable if your parents saw this content?  How about your manager?  If this makes you nervous, consider how important it for you to share it.
- Keep in mind, you don’t need to whitewash your content.  For example, if a political issue is important to you, and you’ve posted about it respectfully, it’s ok, even if others disagree!  Know the difference between inappropriate and a difference of opinion.


## Don’ts
- Don’t treat each platform the same.  Post content only on platforms where it is appropriate.  For LinkedIn, make sure you’re keeping your personal brand and self-marketing strategy in mind.
- Don’t assume your privacy settings are blocking everyone you think they are.  Your connections have a wealth of connections, and what they share of yours expands to an infinitely wider network.  Assume what you post is public.
- Don’t avoid sharing content that is relevant and appropriate for your brand.  Use your content choices to engage your network.
- Don’t post as though your contributions are only words on a screen.  Practice the golden rule, treat others as you’d like to be treated.  Real people read and receive what you post, and there are real feelings that come along with that.

## Activity
Six Degrees of Separation

How private is your social media really?  Most of us post content with a specific audience in mind, but the truth is, once we’ve shared content on social media, it is connected with us, and we have no control over it’s reach.

Many platforms have default settings that either make our posts public, or share with indirect connection.  Think this won’t affect you professionally?  Don’t be so sure!

- Consider a potential professional contact.  Choose someone you realistically might experience in the next 5 years of your career.  A great choice would be someone in your new field, at an organization you might be interested in.  Consider WCCI contacts (instructors, graduates, administrators) 
- Next, view your current contacts. Is this potential contact in any of your current contact’s networks?
- How many degrees of separation exist between you and your potential contact?  How easy is it for them to access your social media content right now?
- Are you comfortable with the idea that this person may have the ability to scan your entire content history on this platform?  Other platforms?



## Homework
- Review privacy settings on all social media platforms.  Who can view your content?  Which content can they view?
- Review recent content.  Considering the activity above, are you comfortable with this content remaining posted?  Edit as needed.
