## Inbound Self Marketing
In this session, we’ll discuss tying all of our career search materials together to create a strategic approach to marketing ourselves as job seekers, including coordinating branding for materials (resume, business cards, etc.) and building a thoughtful online presence to support those efforts.
## Discussion Questions
- How do I want to brand myself?  How is my brand different than it was last year?  Five years ago?
- How do my marketing materials represent my brand?  How will new contacts perceive and remember me with these materials?
- What type of online content and presence will contribute to the brand I am building for myself?
## How-to Steps
# Business Cards
- [ ] Create a business card for use during networking opportunities.  [Hotcards](https://hotcards.com/) allows you to input your information and design a card, then order them affordably.
- [ ] Consider how the design of your card ties in with your overall marketing campaign.  Will characteristics of your card be easily associated with your resume and social media presence when you follow up with new contacts?
- [ ] REALLY consider investing in business cards for yourself.  This can be a great motivation to go out and do face-to-face networking!
# Social Media Presence
- [ ] Determine how you want to market yourself online.  This should tie in with what your goals are!  If you love front-end development, how can you showcase those skills and interested on LinkedIn?
- [ ] Who are you following and connecting with on LinkedIn?  How are you making those connections?  Are those choices in line with the brand that you’re building?
- [ ] Connecting is not enough!  Consider the following tips when reaching out via LinkedIn to build your network.
   - Many great contacts receive a large volume of connection requests.  You want to stand out!  Start by personalizing the invitation.  Always include a message in your initial contact, reminding the individual of how you may have met, and looking for next steps to grow the relationship.
   - Keep the conversation going, but with balance.  Even if your contact accepts the connection without a response, you can thank them for the connection, and possibly follow up with a conversation starter.  However, be mindful of coming on too strong, and follow up carefully.
   - Avoid the obvious ask.  It’s tempting to come straight out and ask for a contact to send your resume on to a hiring manager, or let you know about job openings.  Wait for the right time, and build a relationship first.  Consider instead asking about their interests, insight into the industry, etc.
   - Build virtual relationships into real relationships.  Where appropriate, and with consideration for your contact’s busy schedule, eventually you may want to try to set up a coffee meeting, or informational interview.
- [ ] Engage your network with your brand.  Be mindful of the content you are creating, sharing, and engaging with.  These decisions are viewable - and judgeable - by your network.  Publish and share content that promotes your goals, and reinforces the professional you are working to become.
# Tying It All Together
- [ ] You’re going to market yourself the same way any business or product would be marketed.  Think about large brands you are familiar with.  How do you find them?  How do you know what it is?  Their marketing is targeted, and it’s consistent.  Yours should be too!
- [ ] Whatever packaging or media those brands are employing, the brand is still recognizable.  McDonald’s has its logo, and consistent messaging, across signs, wrappers, bags, and commercials.  Similarly, you’ll want to create a recognizable, consistent brand between your resume, business card, portfolio, and other marketing materials.  A contact you met for 5 minutes at a hack-a-thon who left with your business card might accept your connection, and engage with you more quickly, if they can recognize who you are on other platforms due to this consistency.
- [ ] Be mindful of what you’re consistently presenting.  Make sure that the recognition is positive.
- [ ] Make certain that the content of your online presence is not only professional and relevant, but also ties in as identifiable with your brand.
## Things to Avoid
- Using generic or inconsistent branding in your marketing materials
- Neglecting your professional social media presence
- Mistaking professional online presence with social online presence.  Your LinkedIn is about you as a professional, not about your personal life.
- Branding yourself differently than the goals you hope to achieve. Your brand should your reflect the future you are working towards!

## Activity
Objective: As you work to create your personal brand, the first step is determining what it is.  This exercise should help focus that thought process.
Activity Instructions: 
- First, write the answer to the question “What 3 words/phrases would I use to describe myself to a professional contact when I first meet them?”  How do you want professional connections to see you?  
- Next write the answer to the question “What 3 words/phrases would others use to describe me?”
- Compare your lists.  Are they similar, or very disparate?
- What 3 words do you WANT to use, and want others to use, when asked about you?  Remember, this isn’t about changing your core values, or your personality.  If you’re shy, no need to include “outgoing” as part of your brand.
- Look at this new list.  It should guide you as you create your marketing materials.  Ideally, you won’t need to tell these words to people, they will be apparent from what you use to represent yourself.  How can you get these characteristics across in your self-marketing campaign?
## Homework
You’ve created, and agonized over the content.  Now let’s work on the package!
- Review showcase resumes, online resume samples, and other sources to get an idea what type of look on your resume will best represent you and your brand.
- Using the content you’ve already created and approved with your SSC, rebuild your resume to fit the brand you’re creating.  Remember, you’re not redoing the content, you’re just repackaging it.
- Once you have your resume formatted in a way you like, design a matching business card.  It doesn’t have to be complex if it doesn’t fit your brand, but work towards consistency between the two.
- Share both with your SSC to continue reviewing.
