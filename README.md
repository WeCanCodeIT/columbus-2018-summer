# Important Dates

Demo Day & Graduation: August 24, 2018

# Attendance Policy

Class is from 9:30AM-3:30PM Monday-Friday, with tutoring / study periods Mon-Fri 3:30PM-5:00PM.

You are required to attend a minimum of 90% of class time to be eligible for graduation. Attendance is measured _to the minute_—arriving late or leaving early will negatively impact your attendance. Please inform an instructor if extenuating circumstances arise.

# Grading Policy

In order to pass the course, you must receive a grade of 70% or higher averaged over all the assignments.

## Projects

Projects are graded by WCCI staff. Projects are typically worth 100 points. 90 points of each project will be determined by the tasks that are completed, with attempts resulting in partial credit for a given task. The final 10 points of each project are determined by overall code quality, considering code readability, well-named methods and variables, and comments where necessary.

### Late and Incomplete Projects

Regarding late and incomplete projects, We Can Code IT’s policy is as follows:

*   For each day after the project is due, the grade will automatically be deducted by 10 percentage points of the maximum possible score.
    *   To be clear, a project due at 9:30AM on Monday is considered one day late starting at Monday at 9:31AM.
    *   That project is then considered an additional day late starting at 9:31PM on Tuesday, making that project two days late overall.
*   After a project is five days late (using the above example, this would be Friday at 9:31AM), the project is automatically scored at a 0/100 or 0%.
*   If a student knows in advance that she or he will not be able to submit the project by its due date, that student is required to notify the instructors via email as soon as possible.
*   Extensions on project submissions will be given with the Education Team’s discretion in the case of extenuating circumstances.

### Unsatisfactory Progress Probationary Period

If a student is failing a portion of the program, the student will be placed on academic probation. In this time period, the student will be put on a remediation plan and is expected to complete and pass any portion of the class in which the student has failed. If the student cannot resolve his or her failing status satisfactorily, he or she may be dismissed from the program. The student may be eligible for a refund based upon our stated refund policies.

### Final Projects

Students must be passing the course prior to final projects to be eligible to participate in final projects.

# Course Resources

In addition to the required text, this and other We Can Code IT repositories will contain code developed in class, slides, reading material, and links to useful resources. In addition, there is a required book and other books that you may find useful. Students may use print or electronic versions based on preference. This syllabus links directly to the publishers' sites for books, but these are likely available via Amazon and other booksellers.
